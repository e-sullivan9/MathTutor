 * Date Produced:
 *  4/2/15 - 4/30/15
 *
 *  Purpose of project:
 *The purpose of the project was to create a software that could be used by 
 *children aged 3-10 in Pre-k to Grade 4. The software is a Math tutoring software 
 *that will teach kids number sense and other important skills that they will use 
 *throughout life. Our goal was that the software be easy to learn because our clients 
 *would be mostly children, and that it helped teach the important concepts that they are
 *supposed to learn in each grade. This is meant to be a supplement to schoolwork and helps 
 *reinforce concepts that are learned in the class room.
