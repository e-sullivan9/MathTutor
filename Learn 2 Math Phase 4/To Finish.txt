Powerpoint slides
-I dont know if we want to add images of the gui before we show the gui? seems kinda silly
- but the presentation is short.
-If we do add images, My computer can't load it so i need you to take some snips of 
	Login page, create user page, modules page, sequence tutorial page, a test page, and reward page

i can try and match up requirements to the screen shot and say we met then in the powerpoint

dont know what to write for a conclusion...

ACCOUNT HALL OF FAMEEEEEE
